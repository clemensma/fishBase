# to-do list

## Use this file to give tasks to your fellow coders. If you accept a task please write your name after the task in this file

### General tasks

Write full documentation in README.md (as for Scrape.py)

Write enough comments for every file

Solve the problem that we access fishbase like 1 Million times a day -> save extracted data in .txt or better .csv please (not some janky data frame formats lol)

Please write all variables in camelCase

Divide the coding process in the following steps: 1. formulate problem 2. specify problem in toDo.md and note in README.md that there is something in toDo.md 3. somebody accepts the task in toDo.md 4. fetch git repo and solve task 5. commit changes to your own branch and create pull request 6. after everybody signed off on the solution, the change is commited to the master branch (if you only change toDo.md or README.md please directly commit to the master branch)

### Scrape.py
Divide the script into one for extracting the links, one to create the data frame and one to actually analyze the data.

General fixing of ugly code
